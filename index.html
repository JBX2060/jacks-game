            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>Hello! Welcome to my website, where I put all of my content. I am ______, but to the internet I'm known as "adasba". For the most part, I like to make web games, and illustrations of mathematical phenomena.</p>

                    <h2>Procrastinate Death</h2>
                    <p>A very simple bullet hell game, practically just a game engine. Control the player with WASD or the arrow keys. Your only goal? Avoid Everything! This sets cookies, but only for storing the player's high score. Nothing else.</p>

                    <h2>Procrastinate Death (with The World Revolving)</h2>
                    <p>The same basic engine as Procrastinate Death, except the obstacles are synced to Toby Fox's song "The World Revolving" from the Deltarune OST. <a href="https://tobyfox.bandcamp.com/album/deltarune-chapter-1-ost">You can find it here.</a> This version of Procrastinate Death starts out paused, press any key to start it.</p>

                    <h2>The I/O Game</h2>
                    <p>Take inputs and convert them with logic gates to produce the required output. This is a puzzle game that starts out very simple, but quickly becomes extremely complicated. You will construct circuits out of NOT, OR, and AND gates, which will eventually form the inner workings of a computer.</p>

                    <h2>Adasba's Game</h2>
                    <p>Despite the fact that this is by far my most complicated and probably my best project, I have no idea what to call this, so for now it's just "adasba's game". You're a robot stuck in a laser factory. WASD to move, mouse to shoot.</p>

                    <p>A few math-y animations I made. Left and right arrow keys to scroll through them. Contains some flashing colors.</p>

                    <h2>Mandelbrot Set Paths</h2>
                    <p>The mandelbrot set is generated by the number of iterations it takes for a function to pass a certain threshhold... but what if we map each iteration of that function onto the complex plane instead? This starts with a grid of points, then does the mandelbrot set function (Z = Z^2 + C) repeatedly.</p>

                    <h2>Fractal Rendered with WebGL</h2>
                    <p>WebGL uses the computer's graphics card to render things in the browser much faster than traditional methods. This allows fractal rendering in real time! The fractal being rendered here is being drawn tens if not hundreds of times faster than a fractal would be rendered using the 2D canvas context.</p>

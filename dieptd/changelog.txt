Added Changelog
Fixed GUI text formatting
    Removed underscores from tank names
    Removed "_Tower" suffix

Added Destroyer, Machine Gun, Sniper, Triangle Miner, and Pentagon Miner
    Destroyer, Machine Gun, and Sniper are combat tanks from diep.io
        Sniper has higher range and hgiher damaged but half fire rate
        Machine gun has higher fire rate but bullets are spread (crowd control)
        Destroyer fires extremely damaging bullets at a low fire rate (can one-shot a basic tank)
    Triangle Miner and Pentagon Miner take the same time to mine their respective shapes as an ordinary miner takes to mine a square (and are proportionately more durable and costly)

    Regular GUI is now temporary

    Tanks no longer sometimes persist after upgrades

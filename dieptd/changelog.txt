Tank-twin-triple shot bug fixed. Tanks being upgraded to twins would do an additional upgrade to triple shot. This has now been fixed.

Added Changelog
Fixed GUI text formatting
    Removed underscores from tank names
    Removed "_Tower" suffix

Added Destroyer, Machine Gun, Sniper, Triangle Miner, and Pentagon Miner
    Destroyer, Machine Gun, and Sniper are combat tanks from diep.io
        Sniper has higher range and hgiher damaged but half fire rate
        Machine gun has higher fire rate but bullets are spread (crowd control)
        Destroyer fires extremely damaging bullets at a low fire rate (can one-shot a basic tank)
    Triangle Miner and Pentagon Miner take the same time to mine their respective shapes as an ordinary miner takes to mine a square (and are proportionately more durable and costly)
Massive changes to GUI
    Added GUI for upgrades
    Regular GUI is now temporary
    Refactored upgrade system to make adding tanks easier
        Now only tanks and their upgrades need to be specified in order for upgrade menus to appear, no other code is required
        Keys and mouse controls improved and automated
Fixed bugs
    Tanks no longer sometimes persist after upgrades
    GUI button hitboxes fixed
Added option to disable FOV using the F key
